Like the Arlo Pro 2, the Blink system also comes with a sync module that connects to WiFi instead of utilizing an ethernet cable to connect to your router, making things a bit simpler. They're powered by AA batteries which can apparently last two years. Sadly, due to time constraints, I wasn't able to put that claim to the test.</p>
<p>Arlo Pro 2 also has an outstanding Night Vision feature. It is geared up with infrared lenses that enable the camera to tape-record videos even in total darkness. It has about 25 feet of visibility at night. As such, even if somebody get into your home in complete darkness, you'll still be able to see them in your smart device app. The only concern here is that the tape-recorded footage will be white and black and a little dark so you might not be able to see information plainly.</p>
<p>The only part of the Vivint experience that isn't automated is installation-- that's left to the company's courteous, knowledgeable specialists.

<p>Typically a wired system can be confused with local alarms. Nevertheless, the two are significantly different. The primary difference is that the wired system pairs with the other wise home gadgets to develop a network of home security around your home.
