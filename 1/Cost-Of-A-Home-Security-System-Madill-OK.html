<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal since the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone entering the store.
