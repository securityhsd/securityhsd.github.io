<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that compare individuals and basic motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
