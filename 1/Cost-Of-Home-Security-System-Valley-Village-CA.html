On the simpler side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of clever home equipment for versatility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, but you can't add a ton of other clever home tech to the system. It will not deal with loads of clever home equipment from other companies.
