On the simpler side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of smart home equipment for flexibility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, however you can't add a ton of other clever home tech to the system. It will not work with loads of wise home equipment from other companies. The app is hugely outstanding, and while the level of control does not match SmartThings, creating 'Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or turning up the heat when you journey the motion sensing unit in the early morning - are refreshingly easy.</p>

<p>IP security cameras capture analog images and convert them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing capabilities like compression and motion detection. The caught digital video stream is then broadcast over a local location network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable television to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which catches each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and evaluation. The system can be set up to communicate via network or mobile app for seeing.</p>
