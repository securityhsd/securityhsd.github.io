This function can be one-way, where, in addition to the video images, the gadget offers accompanying audio surveillance. It can also be two-way audio, which provides not just the capability to monitor the video and audio but likewise a means of providing audio direction through the camera or its accessory speaker.

The deals of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance companies call into question the suitability of the present trend in U.S. policing of enabling three or four complimentary false alarms per calendar year, because they supply no up-front incentives to motivate owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>
