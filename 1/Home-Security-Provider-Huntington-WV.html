(You can protect that plug and add another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension set, or buy a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This means the Circle 2 ends up being more expensive overall per unit than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof solution. Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we don't recommend it since its battery-saving routines can disrupt performance.</p>

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.
