It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
