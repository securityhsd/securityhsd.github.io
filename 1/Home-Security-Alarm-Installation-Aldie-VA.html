In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular since the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the store.
