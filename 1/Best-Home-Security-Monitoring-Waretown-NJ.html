<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed looks and face acknowledgment software application. The latter enables you to see exactly when a particular person reaches the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. However Netatmo has actually broadened its security range with a brilliant outdoor camera and security light, the Existence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof doors and window sensors called Tags (₤ 89.99). They also plan to launch a smart smoke detector and siren later on this year, which makes this an even better proposal.</p>
<p>What really sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be expensive but is essential. In fact, we don't advise buying this camera at all unless you prepare to add the membership. Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera spotted activity. Being able to compare an individual and a cars and truck, for example, enables you to reduce unneeded alerts. And Activity Zones are a good perk, specifically if you're looking to monitor a particular corner of the lawn, an entrance, or even trash bin. </p>
