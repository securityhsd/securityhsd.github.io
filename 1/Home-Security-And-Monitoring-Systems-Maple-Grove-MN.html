It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and general motion.
