<p>IP security cameras capture analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection. The recorded digital video stream is then broadcast over a local area network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable television to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which records each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review. The system can be set up to communicate by means of network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
<p>There's a few other cool features in the camera itself such as an automatic zoom which tracks moving objects if it finds an intruder; a handy intercom function that permits the device to function as a wise doorbell (although it does not have a chime or button - for that you'll require the Nest Hi doorbell ); and, since Alphabet owns Nest, the camera brings Google Assistant.</p>

<p>A wired security system was the very first kind of security system that was invented for homeowners. It should be installed by a professional alarm installation team and, when installed, is hard to move from one place to another.

They can consist of outdoor cameras and an indoor camera much like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the team will need to remodel the existing wires in your home. The group will be able to reuse the existing wiring if you've currently set up a wired system in the past and you are updating to a new system.
