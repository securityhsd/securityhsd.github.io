<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it provides protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect sense of security since it avoids only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
