<h3>Best Residential Security Systems Cedar Creek TX 78612</h3>
<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We initially observed Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly became a personnel (and family and friends) fave. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send out notifies, you can't control it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>Regardless of being a recognized market giant, we were pleasantly amazed by the level of care we got from customer service. We were specifically pleased with the customizability alternatives. Consumers can pick anything from standard monitoring to full-on home security automation, with the right mix of services and devices to fit their needs. </p>
