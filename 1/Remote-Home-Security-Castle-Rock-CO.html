<p>Failed authorizations need to lead to an alarm or at least a timed lockout to avoid experimenting with possible codes.  Some systems can be set up to permit deactivation of private sensors or groups.  High-end systems allow multiple access codes, and might even allow them to be utilized just once, or on specific days, or just in mix with other users' codes (i.e., escorted). In any case, a remote monitoring center must organize an oral code to be supplied by a licensed person in case of false alarms, so the monitoring center can be assured that a further alarm action is unnecessary. Similar to access codes, there can also be a hierarchy of oral codes, say, for heating system repairperson to enter the kitchen area and basement sensing unit areas but not the silver vault in the kitchen. There are also systems that permit a pressure code to be entered and silence the local alarm, but still trigger the remote alarm to summon the cops to a break-in.</p>
<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false sense of security considering that it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
