<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical since the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers realize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
