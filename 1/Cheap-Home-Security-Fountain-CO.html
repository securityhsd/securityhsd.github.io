<p>As a young upstart in the home security market, Armorax can not provide the quality control based on name acknowledgment like ADT, however it does have an engaging business model, with versatile plans, top-line 2GIG equipment, and a Do It Yourself installation choice. With Armorax, clients have a great deal of leeway in choosing which security service is ideal for them, and can let the Armorax do the monitoring, or do it themselves.</p>
<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: Go to Call for a well-priced Do It Yourself system that you can self-monitor or get expertly monitored for a small cost.
