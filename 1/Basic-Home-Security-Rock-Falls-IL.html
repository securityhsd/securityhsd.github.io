<p>You can trigger the 80dB alarm if you do encounter a home invasion emergency situation. I am slightly dissatisfied by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food processor whereas many other alarm are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB. Regardless of that, the alarm must suffice to scare away burglars for the most part.

<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk with an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimal performance.
