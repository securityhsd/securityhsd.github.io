<p>There's no use in having an outdoor security camera if you can't acknowledge who or what the camera is taking a look at.

A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring.</p>
<p>Siren Numerous one-box systems like Canary and Somfy feature a really loud built-in siren that must ideally frighten intruders (or next door's feline).
