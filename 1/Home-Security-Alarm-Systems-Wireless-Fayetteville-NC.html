The researchers searched for CCTV examinations released in between 2007 and 2017 to represent the period given that the last evaluation (which covered evaluations finished in 2006 and earlier). Techniques consisted of searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV examination study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV assessments, and contacting leading scientists to ask about upcoming examinations. Both released and unpublished reports were included in the search, which was not restricted to the English language and was international in scope.</p>

We also experienced above-average connection problems, with two Hive test systems detaching 8 times over 2 months.</p>
