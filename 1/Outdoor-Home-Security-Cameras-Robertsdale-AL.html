Improper home network configurations, flaws in the devices or password compromise might enable a hacker to burglarize the system and identify if anyone is home, and even take control.

Our tester stated the service technician provided strong client service: He dropped a few unnecessary window sensing units from my expense after deciding that the motion detector sufficed for the whole front half of my home." Nevertheless, there were some problems with connecting the command hub to our tester's network. </p>
