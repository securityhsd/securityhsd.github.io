<p>Nevermind how terrific the cameras are. The first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your information to 3rd party companies? I've dumped my Nest Cams because they were purchased by Google. Something we all need to consider. Sirens. So your camera has actually discovered burglars or wild animals.

Note that these sirens might break local noise control laws, so inspect ahead of time prior to making the purchase.</p>
