<p>The combination of digital video surveillance and access control is part of the natural convergence of security technologies.

<p>But monitored systems likewise tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey monthly cost for a set amount of time, normally one to five years. No-contract systems, which permit you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than dedicating to a long-term arrangement, are becoming more common.

Paying for the equipment in advance provides you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can stop the monitoring and start service as many times as you desire.</p>
