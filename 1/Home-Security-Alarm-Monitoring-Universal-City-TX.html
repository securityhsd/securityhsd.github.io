<p>A tight wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to find any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to disregard things that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
