Remember that the more functions and additionals you contribute to your system, the bigger the cost. Some top-tier packages cost upward of $60 each month. That's still substantial, however it's a lot less than the typical loss of a burglary. While the rate of thefts nationally has reduced, the average loss has increased-- in 2018, that number was close to $3,0002 (more on that in the burglary stats section above).</p>

<p>We do not advise the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complicated than it should be. Recordings, alerts, and integration all need separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
