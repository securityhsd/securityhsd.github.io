Just like any security system, the more equipment you include, the costlier it gets. When you add wise cameras to any Blue system, and that price leaps a lot.

<p>Slightly more pricey than our winning clever alarm, this system was almost as simple to install and, throughout testing, the loud, clear siren was quick to sound if one of the sensors had been set off. We like that the system includes a wifi security camera and only notifies you when motion is produced by something with the same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no incorrect alerts). However, you do require to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 each month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensing units have been activated.

False alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the cops if they take place frequently enough.
