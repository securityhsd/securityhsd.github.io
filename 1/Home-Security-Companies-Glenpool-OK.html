<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical since the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
