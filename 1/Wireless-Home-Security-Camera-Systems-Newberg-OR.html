<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, most burglar alarms work the exact same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electrical existing. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. If the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits, which implies. If someone were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical present to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the alarm system will trigger.</p>
