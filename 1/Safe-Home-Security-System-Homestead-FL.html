<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest).

<p>There's a couple of other cool features in the camera itself such as an automatic zoom which tracks moving objects if it detects an intruder; a handy intercom function that enables the device to act as a smart doorbell (although it does not have a chime or button - for that you'll require the Nest Hey there doorbell ); and, since Alphabet owns Nest, the camera carries Google Assistant.</p>
