<p>While every property owner frets about break-ins, hesitation has surrounded home security systems due to their generally high costs, complex agreements with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces frequently resulting in false alarms. Technology integration is one Vivint's fortes. The company's remarkable mobile app has actually been extremely ranked by users on both Google Play and the App Store. It enables customers to examine live video feed, trigger and deactivate security systems, and manage their automated home systems including smart locks, the Philips Hue system, and Nest and Element thermostats. Smart systems can connect to Google Home and Amazon Echo, for a smoother automation experience.</p>
<p>After testing dozens of wired and wireless choices, the best home security camera for the majority of people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tapes high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is completely wireless, and can be set up both inside and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have a contract, and its equipment pricing is extremely affordable, so it's not a total splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
