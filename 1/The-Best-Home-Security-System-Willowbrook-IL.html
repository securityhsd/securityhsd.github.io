Another potential disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is generally balanced out by the fact that there are no installation expenses.</p>
