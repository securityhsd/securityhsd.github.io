<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing video footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large quantity of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and frequently over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, however not compatible with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for additional circuitry. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera independently, usually through 110VAC power. </p>
