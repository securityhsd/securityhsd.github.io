<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between people and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>

'Who owns that camera anyway'? Huge brother? The Corporates? Or pestering neighbour? Who draws the line between public interest and harassment? At the moment, nobody! The camera could lawfully do what a peeping tom might refrain from doing. They could peer within windows with the full protection of the law on their side.
