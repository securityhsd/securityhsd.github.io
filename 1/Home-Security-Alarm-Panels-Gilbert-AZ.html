<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it relies on a wireless signal, suggesting that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and might even activate false alarms. Incorrect alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might result in fines from the provider or the police if they occur often enough.

Wireless equipment can likewise be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually offset by the fact that there are no installation costs.</p>
