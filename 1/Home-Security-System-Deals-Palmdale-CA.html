Both the initial Abode system and the Residence Iota are compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only model we tested that also deals with HomeKit.

<h3>Home Security Systems Cost in California</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never ever matches the manufacturer's stats since this comes from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest culprit for short battery life by far. We agree with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, but its recording capacity is a bit minimal to suggest as a top pick.</p>

<p>One essential exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 per month, which could be a cost effective alternative for customers in backwoods. We recommend cellular systems since they're much more secure than landline systems, but there are some locations where cellular monitoring isn't offered. A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring.</p>
