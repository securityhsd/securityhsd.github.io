<p>In addition to the system itself, security alarms are typically coupled with a monitoring service. In case of an alarm, the facilities control unit contacts a central monitoring station. Operators at the station see the signal and take proper action, such as contacting homeowner, informing police, or dispatching private security forces. Such signals might be transferred by means of dedicated alarm circuits, telephone lines, or the internet.</p>
<p>A security company will make more money if you choose a professionally installed system. Usually, in this circumstances, a security company will oftentimes offer you the equipment for free and provide you with a totally free installation.
