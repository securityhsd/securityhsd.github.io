<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, suggesting that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and could even activate incorrect alarms. False alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the police if they happen frequently enough. Another possible disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool should be changed or charged routinely in order to keep the system working.
