This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can launch a dictionary style attack of "perhaps accepted" security secrets based on the "model" security key recorded during the network recovery.</p>

<p>For these separate systems to assemble or to incorporate them together into a single interface, a comprehensive understanding of all the required systems is required. There are only two choices if there are no as-built files providing performance and setup information to make this integration work. The very first option, which may be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial solution provider is unwilling or not available to provide those details) and record the topology and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system. The other method is to change and rip, carrying out a complete upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to assemble them all.</p>

Yes, a video surveillance camera in public places is good - it assists in crime-prevention and works as a deterrent.
