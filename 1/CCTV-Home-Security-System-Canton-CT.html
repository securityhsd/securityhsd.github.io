<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it offers protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to identify it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect sense of security considering that it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
