<p>For these different systems to assemble or to incorporate them together into a single user interface, an in-depth knowledge of all the required systems is essential. If there are no as-built documents supplying functionality and configuration info to make this combination work, there are only 2 choices.

<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the very same spot and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather condition.

All of the cameras were connected to the very same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router indoors (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
