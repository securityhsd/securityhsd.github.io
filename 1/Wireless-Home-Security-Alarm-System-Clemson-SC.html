<p>Nevermind how excellent the cameras are. The first question you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your information to third party companies? I've dumped my Nest Cams because they were purchased by Google. Something all of us require to think of. Sirens. So your camera has actually discovered intruders or wild animals. Do you wish to terrify them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will work. Note that these sirens might violate local sound control laws, so check ahead of time before making the purchase.</p>
<p>Furthermore they can not send fluid video, just still frame images or low resolution bits of video.
