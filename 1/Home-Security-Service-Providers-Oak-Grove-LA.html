<p>One of the top home security suppliers considering that going into the business in 1992, Protect America provides service for numerous thousands of customers around the United States and Canada.

In fact, a lot of customers were not mindful they were making such a long term commitment. This, coupled with the serious penalty for early cancellation-100% of the staying balance plus paying for all of the equipment-may provide some pause in choosing Protect America as their home security service.</p>
