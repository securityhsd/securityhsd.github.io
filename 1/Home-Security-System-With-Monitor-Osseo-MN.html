<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. If recording footage in the dark is a priority, make sure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>Security cameras do raise important privacy concerns, because they can allow you to spy on household, pals, and anybody else who crosses the limit of your home, perhaps without their consent.
