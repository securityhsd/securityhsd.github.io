Some may have a serial port for connection to a professional's computer system for diagnostics. These are the real heart of the system.

In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for further wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR.
