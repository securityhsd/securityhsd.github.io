<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical because the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers understand that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
