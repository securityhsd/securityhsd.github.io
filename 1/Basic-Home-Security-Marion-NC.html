Reliability has long been at the heart of the debate over hardwired versus wireless home security systems.

While enhancements over the last few years have actually made the technology more popular and robust (some systems today have their own distinct wireless technology, which can't be hindered by other signals), concerns persist over vulnerabilities that don't affect hardwired systems.</p>
<p>It's a valid question-- do you really know your options? It's trivial that you know the best home security systems like the back of your hand. But it is necessary that you understand the basic rundown of the industry leaders.
