<h3>Best Security Home System Clifton Park NY 12065</h3>

<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize individuals the camera is finding using face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those individuals and will send smartphone informs with that information when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify predicted visitors from random strangers. We likewise discovered the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
