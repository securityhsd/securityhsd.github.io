Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing, thanks to irregular and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

It's easy to set up and, thanks to its magnetic, rotating base, it can be installed nearly anywhere inside.
