<p>Due to the fact that it's more complex than it should be, we do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, informs, and combination all require different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>The biggest benefit of this CCTV camera type is that dome cameras are rather deceptive on where they are taking a look at. You can never ever tell by taking a look at it in distance.
