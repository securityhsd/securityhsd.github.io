It can distinguish between general motion and individuals, so it minimizes false alarms, and it can even recognize people you have actually labeled (after a learning period). However like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>The greatest, baddest feature is the Arlo Ultra's 4K video streaming with HDR, which provides you extremely crisp, clear footage that lets you focus on details like faces and license plates without screwing up your image quality.
