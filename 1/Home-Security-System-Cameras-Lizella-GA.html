<p>Remote Locations - If a location around your business is secluded, possibilities are unpleasant characters are going to detect that, making these areas popular for planning and bring out theft. One common location is near a dumpster-a worker might throw away the taken products only to retrieve them later or send out an accomplice for the retrieval. Security cameras present near a dumpster can discourage this activity.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal because the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers understand that the economical customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>

But you can't buy this camera by itself-- you need to contribute to a complete Vivint home security system. </p>
