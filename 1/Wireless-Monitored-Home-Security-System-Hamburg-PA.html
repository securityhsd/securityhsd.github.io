Alternately, if you don't have a home automation center, search for a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth lock that includes its own mobile app. Smart locks utilize basic pre-drilled holes and are fairly simple to install. Some designs use your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and connect to the within your door, while others require that you remove your existing interior and exterior escutcheons and change the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>
