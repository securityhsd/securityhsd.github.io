<p>Nothing is more crucial than safeguarding what you treasure most ... your family and home. You don't have to purchase a multi-million dollar surveillance system to keep an eye on your home and belongings. In case your alarm system is triggered, your home security system sends a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security specialists are waiting to respond by instantaneously getting in touch with you and if need be, the regional medical, fire or cops authorities.</p>
<p>The alarm user has thirty (30) days from the date of notification to submit an appeal. Appeals should remain in composing and accompanied by supporting paperwork.
