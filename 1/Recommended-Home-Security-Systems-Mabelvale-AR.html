<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large quantity of information required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and frequently over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trusted, but not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for additional wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less wiring in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera individually, normally via 110VAC power. </p>
