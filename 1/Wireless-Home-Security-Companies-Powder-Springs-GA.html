<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technically innovative outdoor camera we've evaluated. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare general motion and people, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even identify individuals you've identified (after a learning period).
