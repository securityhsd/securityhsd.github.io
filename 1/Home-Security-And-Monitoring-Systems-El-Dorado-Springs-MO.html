<p>Nevermind how great the cameras are. The very first question you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your data to third party companies? I have actually dumped my Nest Cams because they were bought by Google. Something all of us require to consider. Sirens. So your camera has detected burglars or wild animals. Do you wish to scare them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will work. Note that these sirens might breach local sound control laws, so check ahead of time before making the purchase.</p>
<p>Another advantage to monitored systems is if you buy a monitored security plan, the very same company that monitors the system will install it for you. Having a professional set up the system may give you more self-confidence than if you did the work yourself if you're not mechanically likely. Wireless cameras can't have everything-- enjoy things inside by day, and watch on what's going on outside after dark. It seldom works.</p>
<p>It would be easy to roll your eyes at this last point, however it implies you can ask your home security camera for the weather report - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the system will reply. It likewise implies that if you really saw a burglar riffle through your home, you could rapidly record a message to him or her through your smartphone, and the Nest would play it aloud. Which, you think of, would suffice to send out even the most dedicated profession criminal scuttling empty-handed down the road. </p>
