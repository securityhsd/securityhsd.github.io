<p>In the past, a surveillance security system usually consisted of numerous cameras connected-- either hardwired or wireless-- to a digital video recorder (DVR), which tape-recorded the images and displayed them on a closed circuit tv (CCTV) or monitor.

Alternately, try to find a camera that uses a cloud storage strategy.</p>
