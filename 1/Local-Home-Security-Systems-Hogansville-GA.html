<p>A self-monitored home security system counts on the homeowner to see their home and contact police in case of an emergency.

<p>Our alarm systems may be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to acknowledge an offense. When a zone has been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. When the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the alarm system's keypad and shutting off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
