In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal because the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
