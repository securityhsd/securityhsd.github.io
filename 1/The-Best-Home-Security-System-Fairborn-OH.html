<h3>Motion Activated Security Camera Fairborn OH 45324</h3>
<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to check in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We first observed Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it quickly ended up being a personnel (and friends and family) fave. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send notifies, you can't manage it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
<p>This self monitored alarm system has 4 intelligent modes-- Home, Away, Night, and Private. Based upon that, the camera switches on or off depending upon your location. The camera records 1080p videos with a 147-degree wide angle lens that minimizes all blind areas and offers you access to a larger field of view than a lot of cameras. It is likewise equipped with a 3x digital zoom function that enables you to focus and record information such as facial features in case of burglaries.</p>
<p>You can pick from SimpliSafe's original acclaimed system or their newest line of equipment. Both systems offer outstanding, trustworthy home security. With the more recent system, you will pay more, however that greater rate includes a system that is smaller, much faster, and more powerful. At half the size of the original system, the tiny sensors are practically invisible. The new system works 5 times faster, and the alarm is 50% louder to scare off intruders. </p>
