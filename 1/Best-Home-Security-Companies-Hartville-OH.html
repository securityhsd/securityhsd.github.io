The innovation slowly progressed into the extremely advanced yet inexpensive systems available today. The very first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape-record video and watch it later.

The previous, less expensive version of the outdoor Nest cam is still on sale too if you want to conserve some money - it does have actually a cable television attached however, instead of working wirelessly, which means it's a bit much easier to sabotage for possible intruders.
