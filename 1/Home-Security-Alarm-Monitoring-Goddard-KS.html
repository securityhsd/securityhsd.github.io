<p>Recently, Ring denied reports that it had suffered an information breach, but we concur with its suggestion that users should reset passwords and allow two-factor authentication as a preventive measure. All smart-home devices are susceptible to such events. Nevertheless, after this most current entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have actually decided to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? area from our smart video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it concerns video products, we do not believe that these concerns modify the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our present recommendation.</p>
