<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is top quality, if not especially innovative, so we're truly advising the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan choice. Sure, you get a lower price if you go with a three-year agreement, however because Nest requires you to pay 100% of your staying agreement if you cancel, it's a big commitment.
