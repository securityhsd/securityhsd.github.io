Throughout screening, we found it was easy to arm and disarm and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren rapidly setting off when motion was discovered. We enjoy that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your home, which can get costly. It's also worth noting that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it only keeps track of for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly. It likewise had the quietest alarm of all that we checked and there's no external monitoring service readily available.</p>

Furthermore, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the risk and, if required, could merely push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
