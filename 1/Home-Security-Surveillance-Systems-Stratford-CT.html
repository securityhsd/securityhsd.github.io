They're fantastic for storage facilities.

<p>It would be simple to roll your eyes at this last point, but it means you can ask your home security camera for the weather forecast - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the unit will reply.

Which, you envision, would suffice to send even the most committed profession criminal scampering empty-handed down the road. </p>
