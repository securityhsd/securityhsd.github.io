<p>Nevermind how fantastic the cameras are. The first question you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your information to 3rd party companies? I've dropped my Nest Cams because they were purchased by Google. Something we all require to consider. Sirens. So your camera has actually identified trespassers or wild animals.
