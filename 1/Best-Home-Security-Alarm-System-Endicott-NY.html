Ninety percent of theft is internal; see what goes on that you wouldn't otherwise understand about. Make sure that your operational and safety treatments are being followed and review any accidents that occur. Afford yourself the peace of mind and practical benefits of protecting your staff members and possessions.</p>
<p>We didn't think about alarm systems that required expert installation. Pro-installed systems normally cost more, use equipment similar to that of Do It Yourself systems, come with long and typically difficult agreements, and often rely on the very same monitoring companies that self-installed systems utilize, so they provide little advantage. A good example is the Vivint system, which we have actually reviewed individually and do not advise for many people.</p>
