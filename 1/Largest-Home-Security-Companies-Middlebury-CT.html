For starters, Deep Learning allows someone to find what they are trying to find without having to explore hours of useless video footage.  Picture a webpage that works a lot like a Google search, where you can explain the aspects you are looking for in the taped video footage.  For example, if we require to see all video from today that has a police car in it, we simply type cops" into the search window and in seconds every secret frame of video with a police cruiser appears.

<p>Are privately owned, operated surveillance cameras to be treated the very same method as public cameras? We likewise need to draw fine lines about 'Who actually is viewing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyway'? Huge sibling? The Corporates? Or harassing neighbour? Who draws the line in between public interest and harassment? At the minute, no one!

If a person was standing enjoying outside a window it could be a crime, yet the same person might place a surveillance camera then remotely see a person within the privacy of their home. Most notably, it is not versus the chastening code.</p>
<p>It would be simple to roll your eyes at this last point, but it implies you can ask your home security camera for the weather forecast - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the system will reply. It likewise indicates that if you really saw a burglar riffle through your home, you could quickly tape a message to him or her through your smart device, and the Nest would play it aloud.
