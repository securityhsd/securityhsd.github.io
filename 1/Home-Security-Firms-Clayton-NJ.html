<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We first saw Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it rapidly ended up being a staff (and family and friends) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send out alerts, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

Which, you imagine, would suffice to send out even the most committed profession criminal scampering empty-handed down the road. </p>
