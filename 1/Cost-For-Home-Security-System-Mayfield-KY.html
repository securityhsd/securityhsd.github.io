<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see at night. If capturing footage in the dark is a top priority, make certain your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>You can select from SimpliSafe's original acclaimed system or their latest line of equipment. Both systems use exceptional, reputable home security.
