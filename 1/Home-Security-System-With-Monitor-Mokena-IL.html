<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most highly innovative outdoor camera we have actually checked.

To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare general motion and people, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even recognize individuals you've identified (after a learning duration).

Hardwired systems need minimal maintenance, and short of a general power interruption, are more difficult to disrupt. Regardless of a general enhancement in wireless technology, there seem fewer ways for hardwired systems to be interfered with and incapacitated. </p>
