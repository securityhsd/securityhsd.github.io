<p>A little more pricey than our winning clever alarm, this system was almost as simple to install and, throughout testing, the loud, clear siren was quick to sound if among the sensing units had actually been activated. We love that the system includes a wifi security camera and just alerts you when motion is created by something with the same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no false informs). Nevertheless, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 each month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensing units have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have key fobs and additional sensors, too.</p>
<p>The answer depends on the kind of system involved. The systems are best specified by the kinds of cameras used. There are 2 typical types of cameras in usage today: Analog and IP-based cameras.
