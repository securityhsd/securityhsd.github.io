<h2>Home Security System Statistics Gloucester</h2>
<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  , if you want to get out of the contract you have to pay 75% of the contract.. So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no concept I remained in, to go out I need to pay $783.  Really frustrating. Once again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not discuss the 3 year dedication. I called their client service team and they acknowledged that the sales people do not have to discuss it, it's on you to check out the fine print.
