<h3>Home Alarm Systems in Macon MS</h3>

<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to identify it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false sense of security because it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
