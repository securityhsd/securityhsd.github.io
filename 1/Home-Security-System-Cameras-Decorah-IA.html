<p>Even though 1080p is normally the standard resolution for cameras we've evaluated, there are advantages to models with higher-resolution sensors. Couple of home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but almost all have digital zoom, which crop and expand whatever the camera is recording. The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally focus and still be able to see things plainly.</p>
<p>Due to the limited level of control (in comparison to onsite security management), it's essential to establish a clear and detailed security framework.

<p>For these separate systems to assemble or to integrate them together into a single user interface, a detailed understanding of all the required systems is necessary. If there are no as-built files supplying functionality and configuration details to make this integration work, there are just two options. The first option, which may be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original solution provider is unavailable or reluctant to supply those information) and document the geography and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system. The other approach is to rip and change, performing a complete upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to assemble them all.</p>
