<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest).
