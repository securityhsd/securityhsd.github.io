<p>First and foremost, it's hard to dislike the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other choices, but it's better than a lot of cameras that are 4 times the rate. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). Nevertheless, after practically 2 years of day, night and usage images have always been clear, and we never had problems with the camera missing motion, an issue we encountered when evaluating the Wyze Camera Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a smart function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion detected.

It costs a lot, its prices isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to discuss that the customer care experience differs widely depending upon the dealership you opt for. </p>
