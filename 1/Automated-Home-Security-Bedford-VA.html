<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
