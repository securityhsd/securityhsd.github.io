<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
