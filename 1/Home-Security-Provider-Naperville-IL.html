And while this is a pretty basic feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is reasonably unusual in outdoor security cameras.</p>

One typical place is near a dumpster-a worker might discard the taken items only to retrieve them later or send out an accomplice for the retrieval.

<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by a professional home security company.
