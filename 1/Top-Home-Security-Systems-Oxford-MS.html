We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare people and general motion. We believe that's costly.</p>

<p>I described that all we would require to do is take advantage of any one of the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also included two-way audio, and that camera would become the user interface into the VMS system. When a client presses the emergency button, it sends double alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Additionally, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the danger and, if required, might just press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>

<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and frequently over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for additional wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls however will still require cables to power the security camera independently, usually through 110VAC power. </p>
