<p>One of the challenges smart alarm systems position to the consumer is the threat of being hacked. Improper home network configurations, flaws in the gadgets or password compromise could enable a hacker to break into the system and identify if anybody is home, or perhaps take control. Though keeping the large amount of information can be an issue, it's not unusual for IP CCTV systems to have software that governs for how long the video is stored, and at what quality. After a time, video can be compressed to save storage space, for example.</p>
<p>In addition, IP cameras are compatible with network video recorders (NVRs), which offer several other advantages over the older digital video recorders (DVRs) that this guide will cover. In short, NVR records higher-quality video and permits systems to be scaled up much more quickly than can be made with DVR. For additional information on video recorders, see the area below. </p>
