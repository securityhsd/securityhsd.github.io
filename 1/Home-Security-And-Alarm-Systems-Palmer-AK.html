Salt Lake City requires verification from a personal security personnel. Numerous cities also require an authorization to even operate a home and own security system. Rules such as these are created to limit the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Lots of municipalities will fine you for too many incorrect alarms.</p>
