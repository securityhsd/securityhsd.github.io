<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We first saw Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it rapidly became a staff (and family and friends) favorite.

It can't send signals, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
