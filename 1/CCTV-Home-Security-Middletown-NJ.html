<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it provides protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software application to discover it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just a false complacency considering that it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal given that the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
