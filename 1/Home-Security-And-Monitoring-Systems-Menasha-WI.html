<p>Recently, Ring denied reports that it had actually suffered an information breach, but we agree with its suggestion that users should reset passwords and allow two-factor authentication as a precautionary step. All smart-home gadgets are vulnerable to such incidents.

If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? section from our smart video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it concerns video products, we do not think that these concerns alter the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our existing suggestion.</p>
