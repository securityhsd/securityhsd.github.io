We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that compare individuals and basic motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
