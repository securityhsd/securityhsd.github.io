<p>In spite of having an operating temperature level of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be more difficult to install due to its restricted, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug.

Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we do not suggest it since its battery-saving regimens can disrupt performance.</p>
