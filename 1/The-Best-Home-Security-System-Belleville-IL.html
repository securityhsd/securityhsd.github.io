<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can determine people the camera is spotting utilizing face acknowledgment.

We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We likewise found the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
