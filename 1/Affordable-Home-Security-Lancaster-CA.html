<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers recognize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
