<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it provides protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to identify it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false sense of security because it avoids just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
