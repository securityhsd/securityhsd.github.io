Again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not point out the 3 year dedication. I called their client service group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to discuss it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the swelling amount, because obviously they car renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send in a composed not by mail.

<p>The Ring Floodlight Camera combines two important gadgets in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera discovers motion, it turns on its two powerful LED beams as well as its sharp 1080p camera, and starts recording.

<p>The possible value of public surveillance technology was well demonstrated all the way back in April, 2013 when private investigators identified the 2 suspects in the Boston Marathon battle after sorting through video images captured by the city's cameras.

Unless you only have one door and one window, you'll need more than the only contact sensor that is available in Ring's five-piece package.</p>
