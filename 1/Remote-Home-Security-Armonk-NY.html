Technically, most home security cameras support infrared LED illumination, versus true night vision based upon image accumulation or thermal vision. Be that as it may, some camera's will change to night vision immediately in low-light conditions, while others enable you to customize when and how it ought to be activated.</p>

<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month fee for a set amount of time, normally one to 5 years.

These systems in some cases cost more in advance for the hardware than pro systems that provide a discount rate in exchange for that prolonged service contract.
