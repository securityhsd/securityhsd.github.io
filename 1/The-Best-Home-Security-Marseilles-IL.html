<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>We also like that Ring still has decent wise home support. Some other cheap security systems, like SimpliSafe and Cove, don't work so well with wise home devices like lights and locks. Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can incorporate your smart outlets with your total security system. Wireless keypads and keychains so you can control your alarm system from anywhere inside or near your business. </p>
