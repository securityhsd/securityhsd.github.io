Whatever the components are (camera, motion sensor, window sensing unit, smart lock, and so on), I want to ensure that they all quickly communicate with your app that is constantly at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the big quantity of information required by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trustworthy, but not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for further circuitry. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may require less circuitry in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera separately, typically through 110VAC power. </p>
