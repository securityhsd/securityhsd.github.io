<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly common. If a house owner forgets their keys and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is triggered by a neighborhood feline, it can trigger the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the house owner will be gotten in touch with by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a house owner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Instead, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>

The one time where lag does become a bit of an issue is in between detecting and tape-recording motion. Because the Pro 2 doesn't do constant video recording, it takes a second for the camera to in fact turn on when it discovers motion. If a nefarious criminal was fast enough, they could surpass the camera prior to it had time to record them.</p>

Plus, the Pro 3 consists of a complimentary Arlo Smart trial, which adds much more capabilities to this remarkable security camera system.</p>

<p>Dome IP camera, as the name recommends, is a type of CCTV camera with a dome cover. But beyond that I simply had issues.
