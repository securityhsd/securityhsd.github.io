Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to detect it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only an incorrect sense of security considering that it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
