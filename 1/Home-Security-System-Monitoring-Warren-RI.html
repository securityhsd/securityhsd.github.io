And with video innovation most likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear borders for what CCTV systems need to have the ability to do presents a considerable risk.</p>
<p>Dome IP camera, as the name suggests, is a kind of CCTV camera with a dome cover. However beyond that I simply had issues.
