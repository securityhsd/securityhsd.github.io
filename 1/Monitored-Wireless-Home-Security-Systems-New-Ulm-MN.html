<p>Nothing is more important than protecting what you treasure most ... your household and home. You do not need to invest in a multi-million dollar surveillance system to watch on your property and belongings.

<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents speaking to someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively common.
