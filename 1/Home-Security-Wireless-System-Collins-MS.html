<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing video footage in the dark is a concern.</p>
<p>ADT, Frontpoint, and Vivint all offer pet-friendly motion detectors when it comes to indoor security equipment. Their detectors utilize infrared innovation, so its more difficult for a dog or cat to trip the sensing unit. Vivint's sensing units are immune to animals weighing up to 33 to 55 pounds. Frontpoint's detectors are unsusceptible to pets weighing approximately 40 pounds. With ADT, the expert installer can tailor the sensitivity level based upon your family pet's size. </p>
