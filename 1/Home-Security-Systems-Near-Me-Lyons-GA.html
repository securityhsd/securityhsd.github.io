<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most highly advanced outdoor camera we have actually checked. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between general motion and individuals, so it cuts down on incorrect alarms, and it can even determine people you've identified (after a learning period).
