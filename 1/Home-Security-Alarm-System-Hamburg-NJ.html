<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive plan, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and functions are almost identical to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's strategies are somewhat more costly for the very same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation charges are burdensome, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyhow.</p>

The very first digit following the IP prefix tells you how resistant the camera is to the ingress of strong things such as wind-blown dust and varies from 0 (no protection) to 6 (total protection against dust and dirt). The second number informs you how resistant the camera is to moisture and varies from 0 (no protection) to 9 (secured against close range, high pressure spray downs from all angles).</p>
