<h3>Home Security Cameras in Alabama</h3>
<p>Ring might not be the most sophisticated system on our list (Vivint takes that reward), but it sure has gained rather the fanfare over the years. We've been evaluating Ring Alarm a fair bit lately, and we in fact like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a packaged security set that uses basic intrusion protection with super-low regular monthly monitoring costs. Or ... no monitoring charges at all if you select the free self-monitor" choice.</p>

<p>It deals with a wire or without, with a Canary Smart base station or without, and can operate indoors or inside your home - you get a lot of versatility from this little gadget. We like the 1080p HD video quality, the 116-degree field of vision, the motion detection, and the removable magnetic base which is easy to install. That's simply $0.66 a day (or about $20 a month) for basic home security equipment and the peace of mind of professional monitoring.</p>
