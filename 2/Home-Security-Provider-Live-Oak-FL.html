<p>Recently, Ring rejected reports that it had actually suffered an information breach, but we concur with its suggestion that users need to reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a precautionary measure. All smart-home devices are vulnerable to such events. However, after this newest entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have chosen to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first check out the What about Ring? section from our smart video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video products, we don't believe that these issues change the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our current suggestion.</p>
