<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely regular since the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once clients understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>

Some can send out notifies to several people, usually anybody else in the household using that item's app; others will send out e-mails in addition to text as a failsafe in case you can't access your mobile phone. </p>
