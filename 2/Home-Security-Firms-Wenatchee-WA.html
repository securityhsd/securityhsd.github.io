<p>After evaluating lots of wired and wireless choices, the best home security camera for many people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tape-records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is fully wireless, and can be established both indoors and out, as it's weather condition resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint doesn't have an agreement, and its equipment pricing is incredibly affordable, so it's not an overall splurge.
