<p>Unlike standard burglar alarms, which have a control panel (normally situated in the entryway hall) that is used to equip and disarm the alarm and alert you if any sensing units have been triggered, wise alarms are managed from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you've currently left home, and alerts you if any of the sensors have actually been set off, instead of getting home to discover your siren has actually been sounding all afternoon (and possibly annoying your neighbours).
