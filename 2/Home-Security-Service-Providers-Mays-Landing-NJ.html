<p>Contact among our security professionals with any questions you may have about home alarm monitoring. While it may come as a surprise, alarm system have actually been around for over 150 years.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical given that the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers recognize that the economical customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>

This suggests that deciding which camera is best for you may depend upon how conspicuous you want it to be and what it will tape. </p>
