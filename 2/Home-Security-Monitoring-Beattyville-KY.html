<p>In spite of having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be more difficult to install due to its restricted, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug.

<p>Several other designs were disqualified due to efficiency issues. We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (as much as 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, frequently buffered, and had a reset function that left spaces of up to 90 seconds in between videos.</p>
<p>Any outdoor camera worth its salt need to be able to stand up to exposure to the elements and ought to carry an IP (Ingress Protection) ranking IP rankings consist of two digits that inform you just how well the camera will hold up under the majority of weather.
