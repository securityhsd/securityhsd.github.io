<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to check in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We first observed Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it rapidly ended up being a staff (and friends and family) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker.
