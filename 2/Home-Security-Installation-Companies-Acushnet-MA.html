<p>For these separate systems to converge or to integrate them together into a single user interface, a comprehensive knowledge of all the needed systems is needed. If there are no as-built files offering functionality and configuration info to make this combination work, there are just two options. The very first option, which might be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial option provider is not available or reluctant to offer those information) and record the topology and how they can be included into the new DVS system.

Wireless security cameras may require less wiring in the walls however will still require cables to power the security camera separately, usually by means of 110VAC power. </p>
