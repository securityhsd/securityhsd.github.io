<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize people the camera is finding using face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to identify those people and will send smartphone alerts with that information when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
