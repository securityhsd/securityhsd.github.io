For the ones that do not, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home at any time you access your system; however, absolutely nothing is taped.

This choice is normally cost-free. A cloud storage choice saves your video clips in the cloud. However, this is typically a paid service and the number of hours it will store will depend on just how much cloud storage you are willing to spend for.</p>
