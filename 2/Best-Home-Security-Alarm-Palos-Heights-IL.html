<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
