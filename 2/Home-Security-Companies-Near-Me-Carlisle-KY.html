We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare people and general motion. We think that's pricey.</p>

We have actually seen 1-year, all the method approximately 5-year contracts!
