<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey monthly charge for a set amount of time, generally one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which enable you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis instead of devoting to a long-term arrangement, are becoming more common. These systems in some cases cost more in advance for the hardware than professional systems that use a discount in exchange for that prolonged service agreement. Paying for the equipment up front offers you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can begin and stop the monitoring service as often times as you want.</p>
