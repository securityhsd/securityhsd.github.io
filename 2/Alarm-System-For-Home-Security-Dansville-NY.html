<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were impressive in our testing-- during the day and during the night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We need to keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the photo quality based upon offered bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day. Nest includes the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that may beat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
