<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify individuals the camera is finding utilizing face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those people and will send out smart device notifies with that info when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a broader variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
