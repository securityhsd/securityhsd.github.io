The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be attained with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a greater compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the quantity of space to be used up versus the quality of photo needed or preferred). The greatest image quality of DVD is only a little lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>

<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can identify people the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those individuals and will send smartphone informs with that details when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a larger variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
