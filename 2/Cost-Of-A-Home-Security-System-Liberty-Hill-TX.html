<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. If capturing video in the dark is a priority, make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>

Cameras that are not monitored by the main station can not be accessed our operators for any factor, even if requested by the consumer. </p>
