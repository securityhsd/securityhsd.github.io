<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare individuals and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
