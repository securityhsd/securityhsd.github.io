<p>Xfinity Home Refund Policy for Pre-Payments: If you make a pre-payment prior to installation of your Xfinity Home service, such pre-payment will be used as a credit to charges due on the following month's expense from Comcast. In case you cancel your Xfinity Home service, your pre-payment will be used rather to any other charges due on your costs for Comcast services.

It's not for everybody, but it's the best DIY outdoor security camera we have actually seen to date.</p>
