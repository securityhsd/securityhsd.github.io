<p>Simply put, security doorbells are just small security cameras - wired or wireless - that include a door buzzer and a 2-way intercom in the frame.

The videos your camera records probably won't be saved on the camera itself. The majority of home security cameras utilize cloud services to save and provide remote access to video Some models have microSD card slots so you can physically pull the video from them when you want to evaluate video footage, but this is an uncommon feature.</p>

You've got two-way audio, you can play melodies just to let the person being viewed understand they're being seen, and you can pick to record video clips or images and save them to your wise device on a whim. </p>
