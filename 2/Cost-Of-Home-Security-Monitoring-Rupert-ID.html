<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal given that the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
