<p>Another benefit to monitored systems is if you buy a monitored security plan, the exact same company that monitors the system will install it for you.

<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and frequently over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trusted, however not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, eliminating the need for more circuitry. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might need less circuitry in the walls however will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, typically via 110VAC power. </p>
