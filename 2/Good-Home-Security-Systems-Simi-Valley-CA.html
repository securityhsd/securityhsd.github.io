<h2>Best Home Security Systems Simi Valley</h2>

The greatest photo quality of DVD is just slightly lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing footage in the dark is a priority.</p>
<p>Dome IP camera, as the name suggests, is a type of CCTV camera with a dome cover. But beyond that I just had issues. The switch from daylight to night vision took about 5 minutes (though it worked great switching from night to day.) The motion detector is bad. I was performing the macarena in front of the camera for about 2 minutes prior to it even discovered I was there. </p>
