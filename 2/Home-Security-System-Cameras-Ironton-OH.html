The innovation gradually developed into the extremely advanced yet budget-friendly systems offered today.

<p>Consider it this way, if a good still-camera costs a minimum of two hundred and fifty dollars (United States $), how can a more sophisticated video camera be sold for the low price of forty dollars?
