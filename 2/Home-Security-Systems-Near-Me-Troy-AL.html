<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>

Whatever the elements are (camera, motion sensor, window sensing unit, wise lock, and so on), I wish to make sure that they all quickly communicate with your app that is always at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>
