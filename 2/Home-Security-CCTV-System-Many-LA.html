We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between people and general motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>

However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer.

Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
