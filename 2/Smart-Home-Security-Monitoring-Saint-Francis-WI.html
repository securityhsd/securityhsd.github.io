<p>A wired security system was the very first kind of security system that was developed for homeowners. It needs to be installed by an expert alarm installation group and, once installed, is tough to move from one location to another. Wired systems are more typical for large properties and are typically more costly than a wireless home security system. They can consist of outdoor cameras and an indoor camera similar to the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the group will need to remodel the existing wires in your home. The group will be able to recycle the existing electrical wiring if you've currently installed a wired system in the past and you are updating to a new system. However, if this is your very first system, the alarm installation process can take upwards of three hours.</p>
