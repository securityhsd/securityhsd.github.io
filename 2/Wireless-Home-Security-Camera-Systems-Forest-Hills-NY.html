<p>Any outdoor camera worth its salt must have the ability to hold up against direct exposure to the components and should bring an IP (Ingress Protection) score IP ratings include 2 digits that tell you simply how well the camera will hold up under most weather conditions. The first digit following the IP prefix informs you how resistant the camera is to the ingress of solid items such as wind-blown dust and varies from 0 (no protection) to 6 (overall protection against dust and dirt). The 2nd number informs you how resistant the camera is to moisture and varies from 0 (no protection) to 9 (safeguarded against close range, high pressure spray downs from all angles).</p>
<p>In addition, IP cameras work with network video recorders (NVRs), which provide numerous other benefits over the older digital video recorders (DVRs) that this guide will cover.
