<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, the majority of alarm systems work the exact very same method. They use open and closed circuits to move an electric current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which suggests if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then trigger the alarm system.
