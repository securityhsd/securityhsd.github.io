National and local data have proven that raising fines paid straight by companies and house owners have had no significant effect on lowering the variety of false alarms. Alarm-monitoring companies have delighted in the benefit of authorities response to their consumers' alarms without any accountability for the precision or dependability of those alarms.</p>
