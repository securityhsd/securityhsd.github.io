Strategies included searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV assessment research study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV evaluations, and contacting leading scientists to ask about upcoming examinations. Both released and unpublished reports were included in the search, which was not restricted to the English language and was international in scope.</p>
