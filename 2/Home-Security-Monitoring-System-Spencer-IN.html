<p>There are two primary types of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: web protocol (IP) cameras and the conventional analog cameras. IP cameras are the more modern-day version of analog cameras, and while the specific cameras tend to be a little more pricey, they use a number of functions that analog cameras do not. Here's a look at the differences in between the two types of camera.</p>

<h3>Home And Business Security Systems Spencer IN 47460</h3>
<p>There is a new trend in surveillance video search technology that is rapidly altering the security market, and it is called Deep Knowing". What is Deep Learning and why is it so important?  For beginners, Deep Learning enables someone to find what they are trying to find without having to explore hours of useless video footage.  Envision a web page that works a lot like a Google search, where you can explain the elements you are looking for in the taped video footage.  For example, if we need to see all video from today that has a police car in it, we simply type police" into the search window and in seconds every key frame of video with a patrol car appears.  With deep knowing video search, you now have a powerful service for capturing wrongdoers and gathering evidence.</p>
<p>Another advantage to monitored systems is if you acquire a monitored security strategy, the exact same company that keeps an eye on the system will install it for you. Having actually a professional set up the system may give you more self-confidence than if you did the work yourself if you're not mechanically likely. Wireless cameras can't have it all-- view things inside by day, and keep an eye on what's going on outside after dark. It hardly ever works.</p>
