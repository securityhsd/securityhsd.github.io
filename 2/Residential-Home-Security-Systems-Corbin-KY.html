<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, usually described as shock sensors, are various in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>

There are just 2 options if there are no as-built files offering performance and configuration details to make this integration work. The first choice, which may be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial service provider is unavailable or reluctant to offer those information) and record the topology and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system.

<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Welcome camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed appearances and face acknowledgment software application. The latter allows you to see exactly when a particular person arrives at your home - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time.
