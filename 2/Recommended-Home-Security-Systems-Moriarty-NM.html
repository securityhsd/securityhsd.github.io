<p>This typically would enter a closet or utility room somewhere in the premises. It is utilized in older or bigger systems to link the components. Usually you would discover a PCB with numerous terminals or antennas for connections. Many also have integrated backup batteries for wired systems and a phone or ethernet line in or out port. Some may have a serial port for connection to a specialist's computer for diagnostics. These are the real heart of the system. The majority of control (user interface) panels link directly to this panel in older or bigger wired systems. In many cases, the user interface does link straight to the elements or service, however in many cases it is passed on through a hub or main panel.</p>
