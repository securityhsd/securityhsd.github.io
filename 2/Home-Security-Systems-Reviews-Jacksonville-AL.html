It tapes high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is fully wireless, and can be established both indoors and out, as it's weather resistant.

Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved.
