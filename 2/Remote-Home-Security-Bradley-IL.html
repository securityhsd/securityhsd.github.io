We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise pestered with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal since the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>

However, you may pick to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is typically provided for cameras that are monitoring indoor, houses). Cameras that are not monitored by the central station can not be accessed our operators for any factor, even if requested by the customer. </p>
