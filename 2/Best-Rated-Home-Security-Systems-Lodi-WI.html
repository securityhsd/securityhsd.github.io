<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can identify people the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send smart device signals with that information when they appear at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random strangers. We likewise found the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
