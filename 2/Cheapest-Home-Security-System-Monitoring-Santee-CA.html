<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can identify people the camera is identifying utilizing face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those individuals and will send smart device informs with that info when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also offer a larger range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
