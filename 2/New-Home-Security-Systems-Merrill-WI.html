<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify individuals the camera is spotting utilizing face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those people and will send smart device alerts with that details when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a wider series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
