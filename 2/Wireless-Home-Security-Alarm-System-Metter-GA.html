<p>A taut wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to discover any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires.
