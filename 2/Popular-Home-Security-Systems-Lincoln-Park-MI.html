<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine people the camera is finding utilizing face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send out smart device notifies with that information when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
