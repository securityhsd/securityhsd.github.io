<p>ADT doesn't have the strongest customer support credibility amongst the companies we thought about, acquiring more than 3,000 complaints on its Bbb page While we chalked most of this up to the reality that ADT has numerous million more consumers than its competitors, our tester began his call with low expectations.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.

Dome Cameras - discrete and vandal-proof cameras with a broader viewing angle, best for inside or outside your home. Plus, the camera does not have infrared night vision.
