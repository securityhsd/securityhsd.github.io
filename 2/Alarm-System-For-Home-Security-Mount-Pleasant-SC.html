<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to sign in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We first observed Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it quickly ended up being a personnel (and friends and family) fave. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send alerts, you can't control it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
