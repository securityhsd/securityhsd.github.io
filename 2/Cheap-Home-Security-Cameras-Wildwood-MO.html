In spite of that, the alarm needs to be enough to scare away trespassers most of the times.

<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify individuals the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those individuals and will send out smartphone alerts with that info when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
