<p>I explained that all we would need to do is use any among the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise included two-way audio, and that camera would become the user interface into the VMS system. When a patient presses the emergency situation button, it sends double signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the risk and, if needed, could just push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
