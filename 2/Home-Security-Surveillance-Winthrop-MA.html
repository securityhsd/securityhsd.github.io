<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
<p>What truly sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be expensive but is vital.

Being able to distinguish between a vehicle and a person, for example, permits you to minimize unnecessary alerts. And Activity Zones are a good perk, specifically if you're seeking to monitor a particular corner of the yard, an entrance, or even trash bin. </p>
