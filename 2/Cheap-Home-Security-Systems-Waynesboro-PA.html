Generally, most renters select a Do It Yourself wireless installation due to the fact that their property owner will not allow holes to be drilled in the ceilings and walls. And due to the fact that many landlords do not desire a third-party contractor tapping into the existing electrical wiring which could produce a liability for them need to a fire happen.</p>
<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: Go to Ring for a well-priced Do It Yourself system that you can self-monitor or get professionally monitored for a small cost.
