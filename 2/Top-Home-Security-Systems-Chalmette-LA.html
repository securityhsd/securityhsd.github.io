We likewise discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also offer a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
