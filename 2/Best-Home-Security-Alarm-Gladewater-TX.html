<p>Another consideration with wireless home security systems is the limited series of sensing units. Many radio frequencies are weak outside a range of 500 feet. This implies that you need to structure your wireless system with this in mind, especially if your residential or commercial property is larger than 4,500 square feet. When looking to buy a surveillance camera, there are a few aspects to consider.</p>
<p>The downside to a wireless system is that it relies on a wireless signal, implying that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and could even set off false alarms. False alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the authorities if they take place often enough. Another prospective downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool need to be replaced or charged frequently in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is generally balanced out by the fact that there are no installation expenses.</p>

Plus, ADT uses more advanced access alternatives like permission-based gain access to (so no one gets in that filing space that shouldn't) and card-based gain access to. </p>
