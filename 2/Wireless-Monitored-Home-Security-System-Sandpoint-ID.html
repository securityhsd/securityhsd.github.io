<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can identify individuals the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to identify those people and will send out mobile phone signals with that details when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also provide a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
