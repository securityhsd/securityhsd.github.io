<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens.

Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
