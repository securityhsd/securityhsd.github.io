<p>The price of admission for the Deep Sentinel Home Security system isn't that steep, even at $499, due to the fact that it consists of three outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month membership cost sounds pricey, however it's not so much when you think about that a live person is seeing a live feed whenever the cameras spot suspicious activity. That individual at Deep Sentinel's center can warn a suspicious person that they're being observed, and they can call your local cops dispatcher if they decline to leave or engage in a criminal act.
