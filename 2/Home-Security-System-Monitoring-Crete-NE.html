If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our wise video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it comes to video items, we do not think that these problems alter the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our present suggestion.</p>
