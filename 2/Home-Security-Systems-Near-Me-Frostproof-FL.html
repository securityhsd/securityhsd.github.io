The implicit validation for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the danger of terrorist attacks. But suicide assailants are plainly not deterred by camera - and might even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can guarantee - and the expense of a substantial video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up approximately 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget plan - far surpasses the limited advantages that the system might provide in examining attacks or tried attacks after the reality (see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

<p>The combination of digital video surveillance and gain access to control belongs to the natural convergence of security innovations. Centralizing security into a single interface uses additional information that may never have actually been possible in the past, such as notification of an employee, by name and recognition number, entering the structure.
