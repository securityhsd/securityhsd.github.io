Numerous insurer provide discounts on insurance premiums to customers with operable alarm. These discount rates might be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and a little less for residential owners. 16 In addition, numerous authorities departments provide numerous "free" incorrect alarms before imposing any fine, even though the cost to react is significant right from the start.
