<p>A taut wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to find any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires.
