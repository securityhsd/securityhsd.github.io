<p>Lastly, I check out a home security system's app, ensuring it's technically sound and user-friendly, specifically if there is home automation involved. I likewise inspect app reviews from the Apple and the Google Play shops, trying to find home security apps with scores of at least three stars or above. Hampton Products will launch an indoor camera under its Selection by Hampton line in spring 2020. The wire-free camera has a 130-degree viewing and a rechargeable battery angle.

Some designs use your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and attach to the within your door, while others require that you remove your existing interior and exterior escutcheons and replace the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>
