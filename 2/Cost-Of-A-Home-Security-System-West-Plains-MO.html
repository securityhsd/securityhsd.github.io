<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>

<p>Wi-Fi cameras aren't just for capturing a thief in the act, though. They're also useful for casual home monitoring. Placed on counter tops, tables, and racks, they enable you to watch on what your animals are doing, understand when the kids get back from school, or find who's been striking the alcohol cabinet.

<p>What to consider: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 each month, but you'll pay a bit more if you wish to add additional features, like a security camera. While a typical agreement runs 42 months (one of the longer agreement terms on our list), that requirement is only for users who want to lease their equipment. If you buy your equipment upfront, Vivint has no minimum agreement requirement.</p>
<p>We tried each of the cameras in multiple locations around our house, varying from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we evaluated each camera utilizing an iOS gadget (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) in addition to an Android smartphone (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint provides a wide array of equipment and home automation items at a reasonable cost, the one area where the company especially stands out is in DIY installation. </p>
