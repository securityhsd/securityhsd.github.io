<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a malicious enemy, given that the disturbance of the network avoids the flow of information and actually indirectly protects data by avoiding it from being transferred. The usual factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering an opportunity for the destructive attacker to tape these codes and use various splitting tools to analyze security weak points and exploit them to acquire unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools readily available which can launch a dictionary design attack of "possibly accepted" security keys based on the "design" security essential recorded during the network recovery.</p>
