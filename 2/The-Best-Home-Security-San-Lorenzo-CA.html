<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak with an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimal efficiency. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near the NVR is definitely something to be taken into consideration. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a problem however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on 2nd story wall, this would cause a disturbance in the signal.
