<h3>Top Home Alarm Systems in Burlington WA</h3>
<p>Unlike traditional burglar alarms, which have a control panel (usually positioned in the entryway hall) that is used to deactivate the alarm and equip and alert you if any sensing units have been triggered, clever alarms are controlled from a mobile phone app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you've currently left home, and notifies you if any of the sensing units have actually been triggered, instead of getting home to find your siren has actually been sounding all afternoon (and potentially frustrating your neighbours). However, wise alarms do need a hub that enables the different parts to wirelessly link. But for a lot of clever alarms this hub can be positioned throughout your home.</p>

<p>Nevermind how fantastic the cameras are. The very first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your data to 3rd party companies? I've dumped my Nest Cams considering that they were purchased by Google. Something we all need to think of. Sirens. So your camera has actually discovered intruders or wild animals. Do you want to terrify them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will work. Note that these sirens may breach local sound control laws, so check ahead of time before making the purchase.</p>
