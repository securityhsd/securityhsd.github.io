However, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 each month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensing units have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have extra sensors and crucial fobs, too.</p>
