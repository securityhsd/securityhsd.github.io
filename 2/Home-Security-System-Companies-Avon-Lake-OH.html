Don't let the low cost fool you; the Wyze Web Cam 1080p is the very best home security camera for those on a budget plan. As its name recommends, it can tape video at a resolution of 1080p, and while the quality isn't approximately the same par as the Arlo Q, it's still sharp sufficient to see who's there.

However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's response time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls need to be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.
