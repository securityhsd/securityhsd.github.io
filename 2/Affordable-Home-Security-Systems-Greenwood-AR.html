Utilize a desktop, laptop, tablet or select mobile phone to access taped and live video coverage from a secure IP connection.</p>

<p>For these different systems to converge or to incorporate them together into a single user interface, an in-depth knowledge of all the required systems is necessary. If there are no as-built documents providing functionality and setup info to make this integration work, there are only 2 alternatives. The first alternative, which might be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original service provider is unwilling or not available to supply those information) and document the topology and how they can be included into the new DVS system. The other method is to rip and change, performing a complete upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to assemble them all.</p>
