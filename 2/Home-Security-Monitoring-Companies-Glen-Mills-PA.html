Now, a lot of security systems involve a great number of components, such as a base station, security camera, entry, glass, and motion break sensors, a keypad, and key fobs, to name a few parts. But I also appreciate minimalist systems that components that carry out more than one action, like Minut. Some parts can make home automation available to you. Whatever the parts are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensor, clever lock, and so on), I wish to make sure that they all easily communicate with your app that is always at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>
