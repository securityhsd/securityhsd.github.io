<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify individuals the camera is finding using face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those people and will send out mobile phone alerts with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
