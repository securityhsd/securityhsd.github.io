Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>

<p>Are privately owned, ran surveillance cameras to be dealt with the very same way as public cameras? We also require to draw great lines about 'Who really is viewing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyway'? Huge bro? The Corporates? Or bothering neighbour? Who draws the line in between public interest and harassment? At the moment, nobody! The camera could legally do what a peeping tom might refrain from doing. They might peer inside of windows with the full protection of the law on their side.
