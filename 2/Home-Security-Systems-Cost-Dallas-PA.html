<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see during the night. If capturing video in the dark is a priority, ensure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
