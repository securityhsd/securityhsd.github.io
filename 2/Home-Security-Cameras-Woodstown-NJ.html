<p>Nothing is more important than securing what you treasure most ... your household and home. You do not have to buy a multi-million dollar surveillance system to keep an eye on your residential or commercial property and ownerships. In the event that your alarm system is triggered, your home security system sends out a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security professionals are waiting to respond by immediately contacting you and if requirement be, the local medical, fire or cops authorities.</p>
<p>After testing dozens of wired and wireless options, the best home security camera for most people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tape-records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is totally wireless, and can be set up both indoors and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have a contract, and its equipment pricing is incredibly affordable, so it's not an overall splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
