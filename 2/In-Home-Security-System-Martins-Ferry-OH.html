<p>As you can see from our picks, a number of the premier home security cameras on the marketplace are approximately in the $200 variety, and a few of them also require an additional charge to store tape-recorded video in the cloud.

<p>Home automation is convenient and simple, and wireless systems help you automate your home that a lot easier. Smart locks, programmable thermostats, cameras, and other automated home devices are by their very nature wireless, and most home security companies provide a home automation bundle with an app to remotely control everything on the system. That isn't to say that you can't have wired home automation, since you can, however automated equipment that is hardwired into your system is slower and harder to encrypt. It isn't very smart. Wireless devices interact more firmly and faster to other gadgets on the system and to the monitoring center (if you select monitoring).</p>
