We also like that the Kasa Webcam Outdoor won't break the bank (it costs $88.16 at the time of composing), and it's incredibly simple to install. Purchasing several Arlo Pro 2's can get pricey. (A four-camera pack expenses $504.72 at the time of composing.) However we can't fault Arlo excessive for that-- any high-quality multi-camera system is going to strike your wallet hard.</p>

The sound may terrify off prospective burglars-- if you're fortunate if your system equipment consists of an audible alarm. But the cops will not come until you personally call them. </p>
