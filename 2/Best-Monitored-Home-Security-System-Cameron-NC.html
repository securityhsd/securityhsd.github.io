<p>CCTV cameras are placed in locations where they are believed to be most reliable, which typically consists of highly inhabited towns, city centers, parking lot, or various other high-crime areas (Welsh and Farrington 2008). Considered that the placement of these cameras is very crucial, the criminal activity patterns in locations of interest are generally studied for time periods to identify criminal activity hotspots where cameras could potentially be positioned. In many cases, Geographic Info Systems innovation is utilized to exactly examine criminal activity patterns for camera placement; however, the positioning of cameras can likewise be the result of input from law enforcement officer and other criminal justice stakeholders (La Vigne et al. 2011).</p>
<p>I discussed that all we would need to do is tap into any one of the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise included two-way audio, and that camera would become the interface into the VMS system. When a client presses the emergency button, it sends double informs: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the risk and, if required, could simply push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular flooring.</p>
