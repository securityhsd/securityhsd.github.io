<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive strategy, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are practically similar to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's strategies are somewhat more expensive for the very same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation charges are onerous, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyhow.</p>

Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can incorporate your smart outlets with your total security system. Wireless keypads and keychains so you can manage your alarm system from anywhere inside or near your business. </p>
