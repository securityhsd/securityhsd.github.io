There are only 2 options if there are no as-built documents supplying performance and configuration details to make this combination work. The very first option, which may be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial solution provider is unavailable or unwilling to offer those details) and document the geography and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system. The other method is to change and rip, performing a complete upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to assemble them all.</p>
<p>No. Monitored medical alarms are not consisted of in this new law. These alarms differ from panic alarms, which are covered.
