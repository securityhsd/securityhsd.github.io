Wireless alarms are likewise perfect for renters, as they can take the system with them when they move. Property owners, on the other hand, have a much higher degree of choice.

<p>The downside to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, suggesting that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and might even set off incorrect alarms. False alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the police if they happen often enough. Another possible downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be replaced or charged routinely in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually balanced out by the truth that there are no installation expenses.</p>
