<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see at night. If recording footage in the dark is a concern, ensure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>

It costs a lot, its rates isn't always transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to mention that the client service experience varies commonly depending upon the dealership you go with. </p>
