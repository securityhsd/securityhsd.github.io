<p>Nevermind how excellent the cameras are. The first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your data to third party companies? I have actually dumped my Nest Cams given that they were bought by Google. Something all of us need to think about. Sirens. So your camera has actually discovered burglars or wild animals. Do you want to scare them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will do the trick. Keep in mind that these sirens might violate local sound control laws, so examine ahead of time prior to making the purchase.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>The disadvantage? It's really easy to dedicate security mistakes that will leave your home susceptible. The minute you drive out of signal variety or turn your phone to aircraft mode is the minute you've left your house open. This open hole in your security can prove to be a substantial problem if you aren't mindful. With a monitored system, that would not be an issue. Nevertheless, with an unmonitored system, it depends on you to call the cops or other emergency services if your home is in danger. Still, the unmonitored system is much less expensive and therefore is still the better option for numerous who are just concerned about cost. </p>
