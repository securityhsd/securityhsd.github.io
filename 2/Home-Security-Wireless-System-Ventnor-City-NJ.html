<p>While every property owner frets about break-ins, suspicion has actually surrounded home security systems due to their typically high costs, complex contracts with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces often resulting in incorrect alarms. Technology combination is one Vivint's strengths. The company's excellent mobile app has actually been extremely ranked by users on both Google Play and the App Store. It enables consumers to check live video feed, trigger and shut off security systems, and manage their automated home systems consisting of wise locks, the Philips Color system, and Nest and Component thermostats. Smart systems can connect to Google Home and Amazon Echo, for a smoother automation experience.</p>
<p>A system that needs a contract may be a wise option for those who are cash-strapped or don't wish to spend for the equipment up-front. Why?

We have actually seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting contract (and who does?). Our pick: No agreement.</p>
