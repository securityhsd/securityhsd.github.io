<p>I explained that all we would need to do is take advantage of any one of the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, which camera would end up being the interface into the VMS system. When a patient presses the emergency situation button, it sends dual informs: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the threat and, if needed, could just press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>

<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine individuals the camera is finding using face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those people and will send out mobile phone signals with that info when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a broader variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
