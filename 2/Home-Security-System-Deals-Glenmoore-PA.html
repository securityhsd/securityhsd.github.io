<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing footage in the dark is a concern.</p>
<p>In addition, IP cameras work with network video recorders (NVRs), which offer several other advantages over the older digital video recorders (DVRs) that this guide will cover. In short, NVR records higher-quality video and enables systems to be scaled up far more quickly than can be finished with DVR.
