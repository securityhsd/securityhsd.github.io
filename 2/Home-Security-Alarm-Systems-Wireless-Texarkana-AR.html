It can be slow and awkward to utilize on celebration - with the procedure of linking to the camera for a live view rather languid at times. The previous, cheaper variation of the outdoor Nest web cam is still on sale too if you want to save some cash - it does have a cable television connected though, rather than working wirelessly, which indicates it's a bit easier to screw up for prospective intruders.
