<p>Nevermind how excellent the cameras are. The first question you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your data to 3rd party companies? I have actually dropped my Nest Cams because they were purchased by Google. Something we all require to consider. Sirens. So your camera has actually spotted burglars or wild animals.

They'll also receive an alert to instantly assist you with emergency situation responders as required if your wireless home security system is professionally monitored. </p>
