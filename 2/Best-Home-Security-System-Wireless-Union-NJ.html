<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to spot it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false sense of security given that it avoids only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
