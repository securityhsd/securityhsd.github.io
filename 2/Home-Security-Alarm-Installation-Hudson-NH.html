<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is top quality, if not particularly revolutionary, so we're actually recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy option. Sure, you get a lower rate if you choose a three-year agreement, but because Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining contract if you cancel, it's a big dedication. So choose what will be the much better deal for you. Go with the contract and reap those savings if you understand you'll stay put for at least 3 years. But if you might upgrade to a new office with different security needs, contract-free is your best option.</p>
<p>You can select from SimpliSafe's initial award-winning system or their latest line of equipment. Both systems offer impressive, reputable home security.

At half the size of the initial system, the small sensors are almost undetectable. The new system works 5 times much faster, and the alarm is 50% louder to frighten burglars. </p>
