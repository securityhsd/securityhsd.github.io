<p>DITEK's burglar alarm surge protectors safeguard your security system against short-term surges that can get in through Air Conditioner power lines, telephone lines and remote notification zones. Alarm associations suggest that incorrect burglar alarms are not uniformly distributed: some alarm experience no false alarms, and others, numerous.

With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be called by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a property owner won't get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>
