<p>One of the top home security suppliers because going into the business in 1992, Protect America provides service for hundreds of thousands of clients around the United States and Canada.

Unfortunately, there are some disadvantages to Protect America indicated by their low C- score from BBB. A bulk of the complaints center around false information regarding the obligatory 3 year agreement. In reality, most consumers were not mindful they were making such a long term commitment.
