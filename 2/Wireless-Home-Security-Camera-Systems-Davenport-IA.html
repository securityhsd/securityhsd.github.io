<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by an expert home security company. When the system discovers a break-in, fire, or other emergency situation, it alerts the security group and, in some cases, emergency responders.

And with video innovation likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear limits for what CCTV systems need to be able to do positions a significant risk.</p>
<p>What actually sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be pricey but is necessary. In fact, we do not advise buying this camera at all unless you prepare to add the membership. Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera found activity. Having the ability to distinguish between a person and a cars and truck, for instance, enables you to reduce unnecessary signals.
