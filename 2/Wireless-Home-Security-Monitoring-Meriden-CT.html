<p>Absolutely nothing is more crucial than safeguarding what you treasure most ... your family and home. You do not need to purchase a multi-million dollar surveillance system to keep an eye on your residential or commercial property and possessions. In the event that your alarm is triggered, your home security system sends out a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security professionals are standing by to respond by instantly connecting with you and if need be, the local medical, fire or police authorities.</p>
<p>After testing dozens of wired and wireless alternatives, the best home security camera for the majority of people is the Arlo Pro 2.

Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint doesn't have an agreement, and its equipment pricing is extremely sensible, so it's not a total splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
