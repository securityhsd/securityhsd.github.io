<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
<p>We tried each of the cameras in several places around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet far from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we tested each camera utilizing an iOS gadget (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) as well as an Android mobile phone (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint offers a wide array of equipment and home automation items at an affordable rate, the one area where the company especially stands out is in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
