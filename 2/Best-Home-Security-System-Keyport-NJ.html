To recoup costs and hold alarm companies responsible for false alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company must be accredited, pay any registration or incorrect alarm fees, and offer physical evidence like camera footage or a broken window to require police reaction.</p>
