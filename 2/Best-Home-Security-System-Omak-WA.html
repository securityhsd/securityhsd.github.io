<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were outstanding in our testing-- throughout the day and at night-- with a large, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We must keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the picture quality based upon offered bandwidth, which might change throughout the day.

When she got an alarm notification while on trip, she had no other way of evaluating whether her home had been gotten into or if her feline had actually handled to trip the sensor. It turned out to be a false alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>
