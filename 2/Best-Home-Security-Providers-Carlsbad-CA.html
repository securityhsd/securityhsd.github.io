<p>Nothing is more crucial than securing what you treasure most ... your family and home. You don't have to buy a multi-million dollar surveillance system to watch on your property and possessions. On the occasion that your alarm is triggered, your home security system sends a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security professionals are waiting to react by immediately connecting with you and if need be, the local medical, fire or police authorities.</p>
<p>Your security system will be monitored by our operators at our own UL Listed central monitoring station. All of the cameras in an offered system require a central video recorder in order to transmit and archive the footage they are capturing.
